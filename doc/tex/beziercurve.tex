\var{pnts} is a list of \class{BezierPoint} objects (see section
\ref{beziercurvegeom}).

If \var{closed} is set to \code{True} the last point will be connected
to the first point.

\var{epsilon} is a threshold value that determines the accuracy of
length calculations of the curve.

\var{subdiv} is the number of subdivisions that are made to draw the
curve using OpenGL.

If \var{show_tangents} is set to \code{True} the OpenGL visualization
will also show the in and out tangents.

You can also pass a previously created \class{BezierCurveGeom} object
via the \var{curvegeom} argument. In this case, the arguments \var{pnts},
\var{closed}, \var{epsilon}, \var{subdiv} and \var{show_tangents} are 
ignored.
