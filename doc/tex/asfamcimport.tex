\subsection{Acclaim Skeleton/Motion Capture file (ASF/AMC) import}

The ASF/AMC plugin reads Acclaim Skeleton Files (ASF) containing
the structure of a character and Acclaim Motion Capture (AMC) files
containing the actual motion.

You can read an ASF file alone in which case only the skeleton will
be read. When reading an AMC file, the plugin also has to read the
corresponding ASF file as this file contains information how to interpret
the data in the AMC file. By default, the plugin looks for an ASF file
with the same name than the AMC file but with suffix \code{.asf} instead
of \code{.amc}. If this file doesn't exist the plugin checks if the
directory contains only one ASF file and chooses this one. If this also
fails, an exception is generated and you should pass the ASF
file name explicitly as argument to the \function{load()} function.

The plugin supports the following options that can be passed to
the \function{load()} command when reading AMC files:

\begin{tableiii}{l|l|l}{code}{Option}{Default}{Description}
\lineiii{asf}{\code{None}}{The name of the corresponding skeleton file.}
\lineiii{framerate}{\code{30}}{The framerate of the motion data in the AMC file.}
\end{tableiii}
