% LookAt component

\section{\class{LookAt} ---
         Align the orientation of objects so they point to a particular target}

The \class{LookAt} component takes a position and target point and 
calculates a rotation matrix that orients an object positioned at the
input position so that the z axis points to target.

The input slots are \var{pos_slot} and \var{target_slot} and the output
slot is \var{output_slot}.

\begin{classdesc}{LookAt}{name = "LookAt",\\ 
			  pos = (0,0,0), \\
                          target = (0,0,0), \\
                          up = (0,0,1), \\
                          roll = 0.0, \\
                          auto_insert = True}

\var{pos} is the position of the object.

\var{target} is the target point that should be aimed at.

\var{up} is the vector that is considered to be the 'up' direction.

\var{roll} is an angle in degrees that the object is rotated around its
local z axis.
