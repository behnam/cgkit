% PLY export

\subsection{Polygon (PLY) export}

The PLY format that this plugin exports is the format that was developed at
Stanford University and that stores a polygonal model together with arbitrary
user attributes.

The plugin supports the following options that can be passed to
the \function{save()} command:

\begin{tableiii}{l|l|l}{code}{Option}{Default}{Description}
\lineiii{object}{\code{None}}{The object to export}
\lineiii{mode}{\code{"ascii"}}{The output mode}
\end{tableiii}

\var{object} is the name of an object or the object itself that will
be exported. If no object is given, the plugin examines the scene and
if there is only one object this object is exported. If there are several
objects, an exception is thrown.

\var{mode} is a string specifying whether the output file will be ascii or
binary. It can be one of "ascii", "little_endian" or "big_endian".


\begin{notice}[note]
The plugin uses the RPly library which is available at
