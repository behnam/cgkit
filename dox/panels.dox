/** \page panels Panels 

Usually the main part of the window is occupied by the panels area.
A panel is an area for a widget that's embedded in the application window.

\image html "panels_screenshot.png"  A window with seven panels.
	
The number of panels and their layout is configurable. The panels are
the leaves of a tree that determines the layout of the entire panel area.
Each node separates the area horizontally, vertically or in both directions
and therefore has either two or four children. The separation between
the children is a visible \em splitter line that usually can be dragged
by the user to modify the size of the area allocated to each children.
The actual widgets that get displayed inside the panels are associated
with the leaves (the panels) of the tree.

The whole panels system consists of the following main classes:

- \link panellayout::Panels Panels \endlink: This is the "widget" that spans the entire panels area and where
  the actual panel widgets are placed.
- \link panellayout::LayoutNode LayoutNode \endlink: This node divides an area into two or four sub areas.
- \link panellayout::PanelNode PanelNode \endlink: This is the leaf node of the tree which is associated with a panel widget. This class controls the position
 and size of a widget.
- \link panellayout::PanelWidget PanelWidget \endlink: This class encapsulates a wx widget and represents the actual widget in the panel.
- The actual wx widget that gets displayed inside a panel.
