    - tag: The chunk name (four characters)

    - pos: The absolute position of the data part within the input file
    - parent: The GroupChunk object of the parent chunk
    - depth: The depth of the node (i.e. how deep it is nested). The root
             has a depth of 0.

    The binary chunk data can be read by using the read() method. You
    can specify the number of bytes to read or read the entire data
