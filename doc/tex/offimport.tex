\subsection{Geomview Object File Format (OFF) import}

The OFF import plugin reads \ulink{Geomview}{http://www.geomview.org/} 
Object File Format (OFF) files. Currently, only ASCII files can be read
whereas binary files will not be recognized.

If present the imported model will have normals, colors and texture
coordinates which will all be of storage class {\var varying}. An exception
is the color which may also be stored as {\var uniform}. The color is ignored
if it is specified via a colormap index. An optional alpha value will
also be ignored.

The plugin supports the following options that can be passed to
the \function{load()} command:

\begin{tableiii}{l|l|l}{code}{Option}{Default}{Description}
\lineiii{invertfaces}{\code{False}}{Invert the face orientation.}
\end{tableiii}
