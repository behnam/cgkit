def tokenize(readline, tokeater):
    """Reads a Shading Language input stream and creates tokens.

    The first parameter, *readline*, must be a callable object which
    provides the same interface as the :meth:`readline()` method of built-in
    file objects. Each call to the function should return one line of
    input as a string.

    The second parameter, *tokeater*, must also be a callable object.
    It is called with six parameters: the token type, the token
    string, a tuple (*srow*, *scol*) specifying the row and column where
    the token begins in the source, a tuple (*erow*, *ecol*) giving the
    ending position of the token, the line on which the token was
    found and the filename of the current file.

    The token type can be one of

    * ``WHITESPACE``: This is a series of blanks and/or tabs.
    * ``NAME``: A valid identifier name or keyword.
    * ``NUMBER``: An integer or float.
    * ``STRING``: A string enclosed in ``'"'``.
    * ``NEWLINE``: A newline character.
    * ``OPERATOR``: An operator such as ``'+', '-', '!', '==', '!='``, etc.
    * ``CHARACTER``: A single character that doesn't fit anything else.
    * ``TYPE``: A language type (``void``, ``bool``, ``float``, ``int``, ``vec2``,
      ``vec3``, ``vec4``, etc.)
    * ``QUALIFIER``: A type qualifier (``const``, ``attribute``, ``uniform``,
      ``varying``, ``in``, ``out``, ``inout``)

    By default, the filename argument is an empty string. It will only
    be the actual filename if you provide a preprocessed file stream
    as input (so you should first run ``cpp`` on any shader). The
    tokenizer actually expects preprocessed data as it doesn't handle
    comments.
