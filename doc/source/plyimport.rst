Polygon (PLY) import
--------------------

The plugin supports the following options that can be passed to the :func:`load`
command:

+-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| Option          | Default   | Description                     |
+=================+===========+=================================+
| ``includevar``  | ``None``  | Only include the specified      |
|                 |           | variables                       |
+-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| ``excludevar``  | ``None``  | Exclude the specified variables |
+-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| ``invertfaces`` | ``False`` | Invert face orientations        |
+-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+

*includevar* is a list of primitive variable names that should be  imported. All
other variables are ignored. By default, all variables  stored in the file are
imported. If you specify an empty list, no user variable will be created and you
will end up with the raw geometry.

*excludevar* is a list of primitive variable names that should not be imported.
Every user variable specified in this list is ignored.

*invertfaces* specifies whether the orientation of the polygons should be
inverted or not.
