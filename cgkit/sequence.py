    """Sequence string class.

    Sequence strings treat numbers inside strings as integer numbers
    and not as strings. This can be used to sort numerically (e.g.
    ``anim01`` is smaller than ``anim0002``).

    A sequence string is initialized by passing a regular string to
    the constructor. It can be converted back using the :func:`str()` operator.
    The main task of a :class:`SeqString` is comparing two strings which can
    be done with the normal comparison operators. Example:

    >>> a = SeqString('a08')
    >>> b = SeqString('a2')
    >>> a<b
    False
    >>> a>b
    True

    the output sequence may be different than the numbers in the input sequence.
    For example, the class is used by the sequence utilities (seqmv, seqcp,

    which is ``True`` when the output name pattern ended in a digit but didn't
    contain any number pattern. In this case, the class will append a 4-padded
    number but because the name already ended in a digit, the combination
    of the pattern and the number results in a larger number which is
    not necessarily what the user intended. The flag can be used by an
    application to check whether it should ask the user for confirmation.

        srcSequences is a list of Sequence objects that contain the source
        sequence files that the output sequence is based on. The structure of
        the names (i.e. how many separate numbers are within a name) determines
        how many number patterns the output name may have.
        dstName is a string containing the name pattern for building the
        output file names. The syntax of the pattern is determined by the
        SeqTemplate class (i.e. you can use @ or # characters to define where
        the numbers are located and what their padding is. You can also
        use an index to refer to a particular number from the input sequence
        and you can use expressions within curly braces).
        In the simplest case, the name can just be a base name without any
        special characters at all. In this case, a 4-padded number is
        automatically appended which will receive the values from the
        main number sequence in the input files (or the values specified by
        the destination range).
        
        srcRanges is a list of Range objects that defines which files from the
        source sequence should be considered, everything outside the range
        is ignored. The numbers produced by the range object refers to the
        main sequence number of the input sequence (i.e. the number that varies
        fastest). If no source range is given for a particular sequence, then
        all input files are considered.
        
        dstRange may be a Range object that provides the main sequence number
        for the output names. In this case, the main number from the input
        sequence is ignored (unless referenced via an expression). If no range
        object is given, the numbers are taken from the input sequence.
        
        keepExt is a boolean that indicates whether the file name extension
        should be added automatically if it isn't already part of the output
        name pattern. Note that the extension is *always* added unless the
        output name already contains exactly the expected extension. If the
        output name contains a different extension, the old extension is still
        added. So if you want to be able to let the user rename the extension,
        you must set this flag to False.
        
        enforceDstRange is a boolean that indicates whether the number of
        generated name pairs should always match the number of files indicated
        by the (finite) destination range, even when the source files have
        already been exhausted. The default behavior is to abort the sequence
        if there are no more source files. If the destination range is infinite,
        then this flag has no effect and the sequence always ends when there
        are no more source files.
        
        repeatSrc is a flag that is only used when enforceDstRange is True

        srcSequences is a list of Sequence objects that contain the source
        sequence files that the output sequence is based on.
        
        dstName is a string containing the name pattern for building the
        output file names. The pattern may contain @ or # characters to define
        where the numbers should appear and what their padding is.
        You can also use an index to refer to a particular number from the
        input sequence and you can use expressions within curly braces.
        In the simplest case, the name can just be a base name without any
        special characters at all. In this case, a 4-padded number is
        automatically appended which will receive the values from the
        main number sequence in the input files (or the values specified by
        the destination range).

        srcRanges is a list of Range objects that defines which files from the
        source sequence should be considered, everything outside the range
        is ignored. The numbers produced by the range object refers to the
        main sequence number of the input sequence (i.e. the number that varies
        fastest). If no source range is given for a particular sequence, then
        all input files are considered.

        dstRange may be a Range object that provides the main sequence number
        for the output names. In this case, the main number from the input
        sequence is ignored (unless referenced via an expression). If no range
        object is given, the numbers are taken from the input sequence.
        
        keepExt is a boolean that indicates whether the file name extension
        should be added automatically if it isn't already part of the output
        name pattern. Note that the extension is *always* added unless the
        output name already contains exactly the expected extension. If the
        output name contains a different extension, the old extension is still
        added. So if you want to be able to let the user rename the extension,
        you must set this flag to False.
