    This class can be used to undo/redo operations. Each operation is
    represented by an undo object (UndoObject) that knows how to undo
    and redo this operation. Whenever an operation is invoked for the
    first time it has to create an undo object and push() it onto the
    undo stack in the manager. The undo() method then pops the undo
    objects from the stack performing their undo action and pushes
    them on the redo stack. The redo() method just does the opposite.
    Whenever push() is called the redo stack is emptied.

    You can iterate over all undo objects in the undo stack by using
    the manager as a sequence or by the iterUndo() method. The iterRedo()
    method iterates over all the undo objects in the redo stack.
