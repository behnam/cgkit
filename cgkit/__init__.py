"""Python Computer Graphics Kit
============================

The Python Computer Graphics Kit is a generic 3D package that can be
useful in any domain where you have to deal with 3D data of any kind,
be it for visualization, creating photorealistic images, Virtual
Reality or even games.

At its lowest level, the package provides the basic functionality that
is useful for writing your own tools that process 3D data. For
example, the cgtypes module defines the fundamental types for computer
graphics such as vectors and matrices, the ri module contains the
complete RenderMan API to create RIB files, and so on.

Using these relatively low level modules the second level provides the
functionality to store a 3D scene in memory. This is the major part of
the package and this actually turns the general purpose language
Python into a specialized scripting language like MEL or MaxScript,
for example.

Eventually, the package provides small tools that let you actually see
your 3D scene. The two standard tools are for interactive rendering
using OpenGL and for offline rendering using a RenderMan renderer.
